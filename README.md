# LHL-Final-Project

## Description
The goal of this project was to analyze NFL lower body injuries in order to get insights on which variables lead to more frequent injuries, and on which which varialbe where more closely associated with severe injuries. The motivation behind this was to get a better understanding on what leads to these injuries and how to better prevent them, as prevention is preferable to being injured and healing since injury reocurrence is a known problem.

The three datasets included are the following:
1. Injury dataset: contains observed injury, including information on which body part was injured, how long the player was out, etc.
2. Plays dataset: contains more information on the plays themselves, including both injury and non-injury plays. Additional information include type of play, weather, player position, etc.
3. Tracks dataset: contains data on player position and oritentation recorded at every 0.1 second during each play.

Tools used:
* Postman
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Plotly
* Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression)

### Note
This project could use further development. I was unable to make use of the tracks data set as it was massive, containing around 76 milion rows. Analyzing movement on injury plays is the next step.
